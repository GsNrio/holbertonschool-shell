This is the 2nd Shell Project, dedicated to permissions.
It will be documenting each practice exercise as the result of successfully completed activities.
To check it out in itself, just go to the "Permissions" file of this pushed version. For help, simply use google or any github and linux guides.
This project is being contributed to by me, the student, and hosted by Holberton Coding School.
In the previous push the added script switches the current user to "Betty".
